Thoughts: As a software engineer, 'Thinking in Systems: A Primer' has revolutionized how I approach problem-solving. Donella Meadows introduced me to a new perspective that transcends code and algorithms - systems thinking. This book does a superb job explaining the importance of feedback loops, stocks, and flows, which I found to be incredibly analogous to variables and functions in programming. By teaching me to view the broader system, I have improved my ability to debug, optimize, and create more efficient code. It's a must-read for anyone in the tech industry who's serious about upgrading their problem-solving skills.
